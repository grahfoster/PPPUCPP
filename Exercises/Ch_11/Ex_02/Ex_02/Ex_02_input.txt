The old ram stands looking down over rockslides, stupidly triumphant.
I blink. I stare in horror. "Scat!" I hiss. "Go back to your cave, go
back to your cowshed--whatever." He cocks his head like an elderly,
slow-witted king, considers the angles, decides to ignore me. I stamp.
I hammer the ground with my fists. I hurl a skull-size stone at him.
He will not budge. I shake my two hairy fists at the sky and I let out
a howl so unspeakable that the water at my feet turns sudden ice and
even I myself am left uneasy. But the ram stays; the season is upon us.
And so begins the twelfth year of my idiotic war.
