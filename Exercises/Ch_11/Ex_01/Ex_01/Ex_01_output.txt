the old ram stands looking down over rockslides, stupidly triumphant.
i blink. i stare in horror. "scat!" i hiss. "go back to your cave, go
back to your cowshed--whatever." he cocks his head like an elderly,
slow-witted king, considers the angles, decides to ignore me. i stamp.
i hammer the ground with my fists. i hurl a skull-size stone at him.
he will not budge. i shake my two hairy fists at the sky and i let out
a howl so unspeakable that the water at my feet turns sudden ice and
even i myself am left uneasy. but the ram stays; the season is upon us.
and so begins the twelfth year of my idiotic war.
