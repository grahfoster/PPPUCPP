 ford if you will please have a seat mr elmerik the doctor will be in shortly on the wall behind the woman who greeted him flush with the top of her tightly knotted bun was a neat aluminum sign that read genertek ford eased himself into a chair and glanced back at the lobby entrance he could make out half of the broad back of the man by the front door a giant of a person in a freshly pressed suit his smooth shaved scalp glinting in the sunlight ford leaned back and reached for one of the magazine on the table beside him without looking down he began to flip through it page his keen architect eyes wandering the room the space was airy and open-much larger than he had expect a waiting room to be it felt at once sanitized and organic fern-lined planters hugged the wall tapering off in smooth slow curves while above him a sourceless white light emanated from the high glass ceiling ford could hear a faint soothing trickle a of a nearby stream but could not locate the source of the noise behind the planters was a panorama of seamless frosted window where swaying trees and drifting skies seemed to shift and shimmer in green-blue blurs but ford knew what really lay on the other side of those window a bunker-like structure of graphene-reinforced concrete it was his firm who had developed the cutting-edge fled panels used to conceal it mr elmerik came a high nasally voice i am dr glover it is a pleasure to have you ford saw the man hand before he saw his face it was held out in front of ford nose hovering over the open magazine in his lap he closed the magazine and shook the hand the man grip was weak and not particularly warm-a hand that had been working without much urgency in an air-conditioned room this way please said the doctor motioning to an open door ford noted the security camera mounted above it and the transparent polycarbonate square set in the hard metal frame he stood up and followed the doctor through the door into a wide hallway the light-emitting panels were present here too they showed golden wheat bending in a gentle breeze ford thought he could hear the sound of far-off wind we are thrilled to be working with you on our new campus dr glover said he was walking quite quickly his short leg pumping rapidly he showed no sign of sweating or difficulty breathing which led ford to conclude the doctor always moved around at this unusual clip oh good ford replied trying to keep up despite his longer stride of course i will not-this room here-i will not be personally involved in the design that i but i have given many suggestions to the committee we are all very thrilled dr glover entered behind ford and let go of the door which made a slight sucking sound a it closed he crossed to the other side of the room and lowered himself into a large leather-backed chair dr glover office felt utterly different from the lobby row of wooden bookshelves lined the back wall packed with thick medical manuscripts and encyclopedias the heavy oak desk at which the doctor was seated looked to be several time older than the building they were in the only hint of modernity came from the electric fireplace mounted on the wall to ford left and the barely audible hum of the hvac system somewhere overhead dr glover cleared his throat and motioned to the empty armchairs in front of his desk it struck ford that a large part of his life lately consisted of moving from one chair to another fairly closeby chair i am sure claypool has already explained this to you said the doctor taking a pamphlet from a pile and holding it out to ford we are bringing your team into our exclusive employee health plan for the duration of the project you can find all the details in there including the precise time frame you and your spouse qualify of course a well a any children you may have are you a father mr elmerik he asked a polite smile on his lip no ford said softly of course i understand perhaps one day but onward to the point you are here today for dna sequencing it is not part of the usual package but we have made special arrangements considering your the doctor scratched the side of his nose unique condition we will use the information we collect to tailor your gene supplements keep in mind this i our own line of products and our own proprietary technology truly state of the art stuff you will not find this medicine anywhere else between you and me he said lowering his voice and leaning in conspiratorially a certain senator graham was in to see us just last week really said ford trying to sound interested he was imagining what his wife would think of this not the shrewd politician she had become but the firebrand he had met at art school all those year ago they would have both scoffed at the doctor pitch told him to keep his snake oil to himself but that was then and now he was dying dr glover moved onto the paperwork which he passed across the desk sheet after sheet pointing to the signature line the cramp in ford hand worsening with each initialed page they returned to the hallway and headed further into the facility ford found himself longing for the warmth of dr glover office however contrived it might have been the genertek hallway had a cold anonymous modernity ford missed the day of off-white drywall and marbled linoleum floor there had been something endearing about those brutal old designs-something intimately daft like you and everyone around you were the butt of the same bad architectural joke of course ford would never have voiced this opinion to his firm or to dr glover who seemed to be so thrilled with claypool work i am going to leave you in patricia capable hand from some quick bloodwork dr glover said guiding ford into a cramped cabinet-lined room a nurse in mauve scrubs smiled silently at him a the doctor disappeared around the corner he muttered a greeting and took a seat in the padded chair across from the door flexing his forearm to expose the vain in the crook of his elbow ford had lost count of how many needle had gone into his arm over the past few year he watched patiently a the nurse stoppered the blood-filled vial with a vivid lavender cap expecting her to say he was finished and that he could stand back up instead she set the tube aside and reached for a frighteningly long metal instrument ford had never seen before it is not a bad a it look the nurse said noting his look of concern her voice was low and somewhat rhaspy a though she had not spoken for some time and it is faster than the blood work she explained how the device worked and directed him to lie flat on the examination table facing the ceiling she pressed the end of the instrument to a point near his sternum asked him to breathe out and jammed down a button with her thumb it took a moment for ford to feel the pain the nurse was already detaching the long stem from the base of the device when it started for a moment ford thought something had gone terribly wrong he felt like he had been shot with a microscopic bullet a line of white-hot pain lanced through his chest his eyes bulged with shock a a gasp forced it way from his lip then suddenly the pain was gone and he was sitting up again panting his hand crinkling the rough sheet of sanitary paper beneath him the nurse handed him a plastic cup of water and told him to take a long a he needed when he left the phlebotomy room dr glover was waiting for him with a restrained smile that is the hard part done with he said looking ford over he was evidently satisfied by what he saw for he immediately turned and began walking again his pace a rapid a before could not you have just taken a hair or a cheek swab asked ford he was having even more trouble keeping up with the doctor now that all-too-familiar afternoon exhaustion was setting in he thought he had one or two more hour top before a non-negotiable nap would have to be taken oh well of course but the lab sequencing results can vary between blood and organ sample and that aortic sample is not just for genetic information it also allows us to monitor your mitotic processes in real time ford felt his head beginning to spin a they turned down yet another corridor dr glover seemed to have seized ford question a an opportunity to recite every piece of medical information he knew about the procedure ford at one point thought he heard the words penile detachment but quickly convinced himself he had not eventually he stopped trying to understand what the doctor was saying and instead focused on the endless doorways scrolling by one of them led to a room that looked like it belonged in a pediatric ward a repeating pattern of circus clowns riding bicycles and flying airplanes papered the wall farther down the hall they passed what ford could have sworn was the woman who had taken his blood though she seemed to have changed into slacks and a padded blazer finally ford was led into a room where he was prodded and slathered with cold clear jelly by an oddly attractive nurse whose light blue scrubs were clearly too small for his broad muscular chest this time the light were turned off and wands waved across his body by hand whose owners he could not see the jellied patches seemed to glow and pulsate under the ultraviolet light ford realized he did not know where his clothes had gone did somebody put them in a locker he felt the lower half of his butt slipping out of the loose-backed hospital smock and laughed to himself deliriously that is the spirit he heard dr glover shout over an intercom was the mirror above that sink one-way glass do know these data we are collecting right now are crucial absolutely pivotal so do not despair we have a top-notch pupusa stand right in our food court and you and i have got a pair of al pastors with our name on them they are soy-based but you had never know he found his clothes in a paper bag on a bench next to the shower when he had washed and changed dr glover led him back toward his office but turned at the last moment into an inexplicably circular room where two men with clipboard were waiting in backless chair one wore a white lab coat with a name tag that read leroix in purple needle point the other was dressed in a dark grey savile row suit and polished burgundy wingtips leroix cleared his throat and picked up where dr glover left off explaining the results of ford dna sequencing phrases like autosomal dominant disorders and pathological anagenesis and penile detachment ricocheted off ford tired brain the man in the suit stayed silent throughout the meeting occasionally he would look down at his clipboard and wrinkle his upper lip so that the thin black moustache above it squirmed like a caterpillar leroix was going off on a tangent about gnau medical vocabulary and the use of betel nut in suggestive ethnomagical treatments and continued in this fashion for quite some time before dr glover finally gave a pointed little cough and brought the conversation back to the western hemisphere ford tried to pretend to keep up with all the jargon arranging his features into expressions he hoped conveyed understanding all the while trying to recall what the hell a pupusa was and if he had ever even eaten one the man in the suit had kind of a weak chin and a posture that was nothing to write home about dr glover was speaking again pacing around in a tight figure eight looking like he wished he could sit down ford was now ninety-five percent certain the doctor were saying penile detachment or at least a very close homonym if he turned his foot forty-five degrees he found he could perfectly fit his shoe inside a single square floor tile i am afraid those pupusa will have to wait dr glover said half an hour later checking the oversized watch on his wrist he was herding ford back down the hallway to the lobby urgent urgent client but we will call you to follow up he gave ford an exhortative push through the door then turned and shuffled back down the panel-lined corridor ford squinted against the glaring sunset a he searched for his car in the lot his leg felt weak like they might buckle at any moment it was later than he had thought already long shadows streaked the pavement like grasping fingers when he found his car he opened the door and sank down behind the steering wheel exhausted he closed his eyes directed the air conditioning vent at his face and turned the key the radio came on a a pleasant breeze spread across his damp forehead a newscaster droned on in the background hardly audible above the hum of the ac the voice was saying something about a massive crisis or was it plastic prices ford could just barely detect a change in the red shade of his closed eyelid if he shifted to his right which meant the driver side of his car was intersecting with one of those long shadows the man on the radio kept updating a number every minute or so it was up to two hundred what time did shirley say she needed the car again kind of odd scheduling a meeting that late two hundred and fifty but then politician were an odd bunch always on the move always making their rounds she called it meeting the constituents three hundred and fifty ford left knee was sore for no particular reason every day that he woke up with a new and unexplained symptom he was afraid it might be the last one five hundred and ten his physician had long since given up trying to diagnose every ache and pain he presented with better to cut the roots than pick the berries seven hundred ford reached for the dashboard the air on his head had become unpleasantly cool his hand was suspended over the black plastic ac dial when he felt a small static shock in his outstretched fingers for an instant he thought he was back in the phlebotomy room back on the table under that ungodly needle then the shock began to spread it passed up his arm and down his spine into his leg and to the end of his toes pushing out everything in it path searing away all the pain and fog and fatigue like a bolt of cleansing lightning he was struck with the distinct image of a starved plant drinking long-awaited rain of fresh water rushing to wilted stem and desiccated leave and then that image became car on a highway a train of stalled red eyes that blinked and inched forward and opened and were red again and now the car were satellites navigating the increasingly congested lane of high earth orbit shining beacons circling above the sky while far below flocks of crows thrust through the air like black arrowheads and silver wolves padded the ground equal members of the same sophisticated pack their mind pushed to the precipice of possibility all this ford saw in sequence and at once backward and forward the wheel of his thought spinning and shining around his mind every corner illuminated and a the broadcast from the speakers resolved once more into crackling life the growing death toll now in excess of one thousand ford could not help but wonder if any of it even mattered george george was already awake when his alarm went off at six he had slept very little-only four or five hour adjusting to the night shift was proving difficult not to mention he now had to drive an additional ten minute to work it did not sound like much when he had taken the job but on the evening before his first shift he lay anxiously in bed calculating how much extra time he would spend in transit per week per year over his lifetime he was fifty-five year old already-well over the hump a it were-and he figured he had another thirty in him barring some fatal accident he was in good shape for his age he did not smoke ate a well a he could afford and ran a country mile every day around the sub-suburban neighborhood he called home in all he was looking at 130 day of extra driving on top of the initial 195 between now and the day he died nearly a full year behind the wheel and that did not include his grocery shopping dentist appointments and get-togethers not that he had been getting together much with anyone lately after he was laid off and his wife left he had withdrawn from the world even if he were to see someone he doubted they had find much pleasure in his company what would they talk about his divorced wife the daughter she had taken with her his new late-night job at the gas station no best he not burden anyone else with his trouble the truth was he hated the longer drive because it gave him more time to think about everything-to wonder how george ludlow the successful journalist husband and father had become george ludlow the divorced daughter-less gas station attendant in fact the answer to that question was simple it was stubbornness that had gotten him into this mess his inability to let go of the old and embrace the new when lumina flooded the market four year ago he had no fear it would endanger his career then slowly the complexion of the company began to change veteran writers started being replaced by bright-eyed newcomers with seemingly unlimited focus and inexhaustible memory george had been offered the booster shot for free a part of the company new medical plan but he refused he prided himself too much on his knowledge and experience to admit it should-or could-be enhanced in some way and so eventually the day came when he was the one clearing out his desk and collecting his final pay missing out on the twenty-year severance bonus by nine day he got dressed and left the house outside the air was cool and the sky was clear although the sun was only just beginning to set george could make out the faint twinkling of far-off stars he jiggled the key in the door of his antique firebird cursing the car sticky locks and his own unwillingness to break out the graphite and lubricate them he used to work on this car every day back when it had cost him his teenage life savings to buy the beat-up machine he had fixed the intake replaced the brakes toyed around with the suspension and generally obsessed over the vehicle he never took his friend up on their challenges to race but he knew he would have outstripped them easily by the time he graduated he knew the car inside and out his college friend even started coming to him for help with their own automotive issues then he got married and the responsibilities of his job and newborn daughter demanded he set the hobby aside instead the car collected dust in the garage until he and his wife split their assets in the divorce he received a few offers from collectors a old gas car were cycled out for electric but he never considered selling it it would be like losing a limb he told himself the car was a piece of him-proof that he once had passion that he once had skill and knowledge enough to bore out a cylinder or fix a broken suspension now he hardly even knew how to work his optik more often than not the lime-sized orb lay forgotten in some corner of the room or on the counter at work it glassy surface staring vacantly at the ceiling it was the same stubbornness that had led him to reject lumina a fear of being somehow diminished by making his life easier of being weakened by convenience inside the long low cabin he reached up to adjust the rearview mirror he always had to angle it up slightly before he drove to work then when his shift was over and his body was stooped and crushed he would bend it back down before driving home now a he fingered the plastic frame he studied his reflected face it had a rugged handsomeness black and gray stubble lined his low-slung jaw and dotted the valleys of his hollow cheek his skin had the tan leathery aspect of a deckhand and long trench-like wrinkle extended from the corner of his mouth to the edge of his deep blue eyes he took his hand from the mirror and started the car it gave an exhausted rumble and rolled out of the driveway onto the road another drive to work past the clogged and polluted creek that abutted his property past the old lumina billboard with that all too familiar slogan past the train crossing it boom gate forever poised to go down on the discontinued line a he drove under the pedestrian footbridge just a abandoned a the train tracks he spotted an unfamiliar fixture it was a crashed car it appeared to have veered left coming from the opposite direction crossed lane through a gap in the barrier and hit the far bank of the bridge he pulled off the road just beyond it and looked in his mirror he saw no sign of fire just a little smoke rising from the rear of the car and the steady blinking of red light on the undercarriage he wondered how long it had been since he last saw a crashed car you heard about malfunctions and freak accident every now and again but for the most part greencar had made auto accident a thing of the past george got out of his firebird and jogged over to the other car a massive black groupcar the size of a light tank inside were two girl the one at the wheel looked unconscious while the one in the passenger seat was rocking back and forth a thin screen in her hand the smell of burnt rubber filled george nose he tapped on the passenger window and the girl flinched you need to turn the car off he said with a restrained shout pitching his voice the way one might to talk to someone at a loud concert the girl shook her head and pointed to her ears how thick i the glass on this thing george wondered he could be sitting in his firebird and hear a penny drop across the street he made a twisting motion with his hand and mouthed turn it off the girl shook her head confused he looked across her at the ignition switch no keyhole just a button just open the door he said motioning likewise this time the girl understood turn the car off he said when she had opened the door a little he was feeling a little frustrated and the words came out sounding more like a command than an instruction i think your friend got it in manual her foot i still on the gas he explained a little quieter now you need to put her in park the car i mean the girl nodded and reached over the armrest she tried to move her friend leg but it slid back into place on the gas pedal she looked around and found a glass bottle on the floor which she placed under the other girl knee to prop it up then she tapped something on the dashboard and pressed the ignition the car fell silent the girl slumped back in her seat looking slightly relieved then she began to cry george looked on uncomfortably not sure what to do he was not the most compassionate person and he knew that for all his self-pity when it came to other he usually adopted an unhelpful shit happens attitude hey it is alright he ventured the damage is not too bad and you both look fine he stared uncertainly at the girl in the driver seat there was no visible damage to her body though she did look a little ill then he noticed the vodka label on the glass bottle under her knee shit he said quietly he took a step backward this was just what he needed to stumble across a dui on his way to work the girl in the passenger seat seemed to realize what he was thinking wait she said wiping her eyes on the skin of her wrist and leaving behind a wet streak of mascara she was a pretty girl just a few year older than his daughter probably do not go the girl implored it is not what it look like she was fine and then all of a sudden george glanced around there were not too many car on the road this late every thirty seconds or so one would pass by and the driver would crane their neck to survey the damage then zoom off into the darkening night if he had left home just a minute later he might have been one of those car he looked at his watch he still had half an hour before his shift twenty minute of which would have to be spent driving he sighed let us have a look at your friend the girl accompanied george around the back of the car on closer inspection it looked like the suv had taken out a part of the metal lane divider which had lodged itself under the rear suspension it explained why the crash had not been much worse the friction of the divider piece must have slowed the car down even when the driver still had her foot on the pedal george shook his head he wondered what he would do if his daughter ever crashed his car then he remembered she had never have the chance when he opened the driver side door the unconscious girl started leaning out and george had to reach out an arm to stabilize her he caught her awkwardly with his hand under her left breast and quickly forced her body back into the seat he glanced quickly at the other girl but she did not seem to have noticed the indiscretion good it would be just his luck to spend the night in jail for accidentally fondling a minor with the indifference of a parent changing a diaper he put two fingers on the girl neck her skin felt unexpectedly cool after he made sure there was a pulse he gently placed a thumb on her left eyelid and pulled it back expecting to see the telltale dilation that comes with intoxication instead the girl pupils were tightly constricted george thought he could see the irises around them dissolving into an oblivious shade of white he shivered there was something chilling about the eyes they looked somehow counterfeit foreign features on an otherwise human face he turned to the girl and opened his mouth to speak then closed it how to put it delicately look i appreciate the bind you are in but at this point trouble unavoidable i am gonna call an ambulance for your friend greencar probably already sending someone out to investigate wait please the girl pleaded stepping forward it is for your own good said george he felt bad for the girl but he knew there was not any alternative her parent were going to find out anyway and the driver definitely needed medical attention getting busted could be the least of their worries george reached into his pocket and withdrew a flexible black screen his optik was still sitting in the glove compartment of his car but he figured he was close enough to connect it was the first time he had used the phone since last week when that simpering rep from bayside-clover had tried to convince him he still owed 500 for his elbow surgery hello george said struggling to make out the operator voice he began walking toward his car can you hear me the voice on the other end was broken and inaudible hello he leaned with his back against the trunk one shoe on the bumper he hung up and dialed again jabbing the three digits into the keypad can anyone hear me he said raising his voice above the harsh rasping static he cursed and made his way back to the greencar he was not sure whether it was a poor signal or his refurbished optik interfering with the call frowning he returned his attention to the unconscious driver she was moaning now squirming uncomfortably in her seat george rolled down the sleeve of his shirt and used it to wipe off a few beads of sweat that had gathered on her forehead it felt cold a it seeped through the fabric to his forearm the girl skin looked even paler than before a waxen mask pulled taut over the delicate bones of her cheek she groaned softly and a sweet citrus smell invaded his nose her eyes fluttered open then closed thick mascara-stiffened lashes drawing in and out like the spine of a venus fly trap miss george said softly can you hear me the girl moved her head up and down slowly the edge of her dark red lip trembled a if trying to form a smile miss can you tell me your name she drew her face a little closer to george he could see the returning roots of her plucked eyebrows and the faint blonde down around her chin suddenly the girl lurched forward with a jolt and planted her lip on his he reeled backward out of the car and nearly tripped into the ditch behind him for a moment he stood still panting not sure how to react then what the hell i this was that the plan all along to blame this all on some passerby he tried to edge his voice with anger and succeeded all the embarrassment and hatred of the last months welled up within him magnified by a growing sense of self-pity could not he catch a break just this once why did everything always go to shit for him this was his punishment for trying to help he supposed-for being soft for being weak what the girl outside cried she ran over to check orn her friend who evidently had fainted again and was sagging forward out of the car no of course not she pleaded heaving the unconscious girl back into the car i have no idea what that was george was fuming he felt a tingling along his scalp sensed drop of sweat forming along the collar of his shirt i do not have time for this he said finally clenching his fists find another sucker to help you he began to walk back to his car please please just take us to the nearest rest stop so we can call help you are right the girl admitted beginning to cry again there is no other choice george turned around and looked at the girl she really did resemble his daughter the thin nose and narrow jaw those long slightly turned-in leg he felt his anger ebbing away replaced by an impotent sense of longing and fatigue listen he said steadily i will head toward the next gas station and keep calling until i get through you stay here and take care of your friend thank you the girl said beneath the tears she wore a look of utter resignation george felt a last pang of sympathy i would get rid of that bottle if i were you he said then got back in his car and drove off it was only a he pulled into the gas station that he tasted the coppery tang of blood on his upper lip
